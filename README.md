# Tachion Engine

Simple 2D physics engine using OpenCL for calculations.

Created mostly as a team university project but also to test OpenCl and OpenGl capabilites. Engine was created to be easily modificable (easy at least in OpenCl standards). In this form Tachion Engine is configured to preform simple sand simulation but it could be re-configured for almost any purpose. This feature makes it something in a form of OpenCl/OpenGl wrapper that simplifies use of their APIs. Engine allows to modify OpenCL code without the need to compile the whole system every time - engine launches OpenCl based on its configuration files making it more flexible and user-friendly (If OpenCl-OpenGl interop can be ever user firendly).
